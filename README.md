# webpack-template-repo
Basic template repo with webpack


<!-- At present (7 Dec 24) I have included webpack-merge and config files for prod and dev.
Will need to do more research into the flow of using these two configs -->

Scripts for webpack-merge to be added to package.json:
 "dev": "webpack serve --open --config webpack.dev.js",
 "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js",
